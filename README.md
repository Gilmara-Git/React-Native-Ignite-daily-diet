# About

**React Native** project developed during my **Ignite bootcamp** with [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

- This app allows you to register you daily meals and helps you keep track of meals **within** or **outside** your diet, which is shown on the **Statistics** page.
- You can **add**, **edit** and **delete** a meal. 
- You can set a **profile picture** by uploading it from your device.
- you can select a **date** and **time** instead of having to type them.

 # Motivation


- Practice ***React Navigation v6*** (***Stack Navigation*** was used)
- Practice styling with **styled-components** 
- Practice **AsyncStorage** to store meals and profile picture.
- Learn how to work with **Expo Image Picker**

- Interact with the Dev Community, learn together and progress as a Developer.
- Keep committed with my goals.</br>
